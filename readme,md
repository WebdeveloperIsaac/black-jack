### Simple Rules of a black jack game if you don know already
1 Learn the value of the cards 

2 The basic premise of the game is that you want to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than that of the dealer, without going over 21.

An Ace can count as either 1 or 11, as explained below.
The cards from 2 through 9 are valued at their face value.
The 10, Jack(joker), Queen(rani), and Raja(King) are all valued at 10.
